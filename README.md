# RoomsDLC.GML
RoomsDLC.GML is a free and open source alternative to [YellowAfterLife's GMRoomPack](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmroompack).

It isn't nearly as powerful but it does get its job done: Converting rooms to files with a `.json` extension which can then be loaded back at runtime.

A example can be found in the "demo" branch.

## Syntax
`RoomsDLC.GML <.yyp project file>` or `node index.js <.yyp project file>`.
